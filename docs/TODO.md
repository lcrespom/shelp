# ToDo

- Rust
  - [x] Frist time use (if .shelp directory does not exist)
  - [x] Configuration: CSS and settings
    - [ ] Enable/disable fuzzy search
  - [ ] Extensibility
    - [ ] New routes / UIs
  - [ ] Eventually get rid of dependencies
    - [ ] Use shelp to talk to itself to get rid of `curl` and `python3`
    - [ ] Get/set window focus in Rust to get rid of `osascript`
    - [ ] Global key listener in Rust to even get rid of zsh "bindkey"
    - [ ] Reduce `shelp.zsh` to a minimum
    - [ ] Get directory contents in Rust to avoid the loop in zsh and improve responsiveness
- React
  - [x] Startup
  - [x] Cool CSS
  - [x] SearchList: multi-search, multi-highlight

  - [x] Routes
    - [x] Welcome / home page
    - [x] Dirhistory route
    - [x] History
    - [x] Tab completion

            (easier to implement when directory contents is obtained from Rust)

        - [ ] Match commands instead of files if at start of prompt
        - [ ] Match env vars if current word starts with $

  - [ ] Code refactor (eventually)
- zsh
  - [x] Dirhistory
  - [x] History
  - [x] Home / end
  - [x] Tab completion
  - [x] Shift-up => cd to parent directory
  - [ ] Esc => clear line
  - [ ] Shift-down => cd to previous directory in dirhistory
  - [ ] Test with oh-my-zsh
  - [ ] Test from VSCode terminal
    - [ ] Set focus back fails
    - [ ] PageUp / PageDown not detected
  - [ ] Detect when user hits ctrl+c and clean shelp queue
- Documentation
  - [x] README.md
    - [ ] Installation
    - [x] Usage
